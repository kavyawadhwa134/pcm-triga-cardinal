# pcM Status

Last updated: 2026-09-12

## Completed

- **Phase 0 — Environment audit.** Cardinal, NekRS, MOOSE, OpenMC, MPI, and
  ENDF/B-VIII.0 located and version-checked. Hardware recorded from the actual
  machine. NekRS backend determined empirically from `CMakeCache.txt`, not
  assumed. Written to `spec/hardware.md`.
- **Phase 1 — Scientific input audit.** Approved problem definition transcribed
  into `spec/geometry.md`, `spec/materials.md`, `spec/operating.md`. Every
  missing or ambiguous parameter flagged rather than filled in from pcL.
- **Phase 2 — Model scope selected and justified** (`spec/operating.md`).
- Git repository initialized; `.gitignore` excludes large generated outputs per
  CLAUDE.md Git Rules.
- Independence record written (`spec/independence.md`).

## Current

Standalone OpenMC and the Binder OpenMC-MOOSE average-pin production run are
complete. NekRS has passed a separate 1,000-step CUDA diagnostic on a GTX
1080 Ti, but post-run conservation checks found that only 59.03% of the clad
surface retained heated-wall boundary ID 1. Those fields are invalid for
physical use. The mesh generator and runtime wall-area check are corrected;
current work is regenerating `fluid.re2` and rerunning standalone NekRS before
three-way coupling.

## Blocked

Nothing hard-blocking. The neutronics ran to completion.

Two answers are needed before the **core** numbers can be called final:
- **Q1** (core diameter vs radius) — the core was run on pcM's provisional
  diameter reading. If that reading is wrong, every core result changes.
- **Q4** (homogenized vs heterogeneous, and which hydrogen S(α,β) kernel) —
  worth ≈3100 pcm and ≈1275 pcm respectively.

The **unit-cell** k-infinity result depends on neither and is final.

## Independent Assumptions

Full detail in the spec files; summary:

| ID | Assumption | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | Natural Zr isotopics in fuel | small |
| A3 | S(α,β) `c_H_in_ZrH`/`c_Zr_in_ZrH` applied to fuel | **large** — essential for hydride fuel |
| A5/A6 | SS304 density 8.00 g/cm³ and standard composition (not in spec) | tens of pcm |
| A7 | Pure light water, no boron | small |
| A8 | S(α,β) `c_H_in_H2O` applied to water | **large** |
| G1 | No fuel/clad gap (spec gives only two radii) | small on k; matters for thermal |
| G2 | No Zr central rod (spec gives solid fuel meat) | ~100 pcm |
| G5 | Core homogenization by unit-cell volume fractions | **large** |
| G6 | Bare core, no reflector (vacuum BC as specified) | **large** — departs from physical TRIGA |
| O4 | Atmospheric pressure | sets saturation temperature |
| O5 | +0.5 $ transient treated as out of baseline scope | scope question |

Provisional geometry interpretation: core = cylinder, **diameter** 0.495 m ×
height 0.60 m (see Q1).

## Tests

Software verification: OpenMC executes, 16 runs completed, no crashes.

Numerical verification:
- Particle/batch convergence (unit cell): smoke/baseline/production agree
  within uncertainty; production σ = 21 pcm.
- Seed repeatability (unit cell, 5 seeds): scatter 72 pcm vs reported σ 60 pcm
  — consistent, no hidden bias.
- Seed repeatability (core, 2 seeds): 5 pcm apart.

Physics verification:
- Unit-cell leakage exactly 0 (reflective BCs correct).
- Pin powers sum to 250,000.0 W (normalization correct).
- Axial power profile symmetric to 0.69 % (geometry is symmetric by
  construction).
- k_inf × (1 − leakage) = 1.1053 vs directly computed k_eff = 1.1021 (0.3 %).

Two post-processing defects were found and fixed; both are documented in
`results/PCM_RESULTS.md` §5.1 rather than quietly corrected:
1. Cylindrical mesh tally reshaped as (r, φ, z) when OpenMC orders bins
   (z, φ, r) — silently transposed radius and height. Caught by the symmetry
   check. Did not affect k.
2. Core-average power density computed as an unweighted cell mean instead of
   volume-weighted.

## Results

Production, 20 M histories, ENDF/B-VIII.0, 293 K:

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| k-infinity (2-D unit cell, reflective) | 1.384207 ± 0.000214 |
| k-effective (bare heterogeneous core, vacuum) | 1.102059 ± 0.000260 |
| Leakage fraction | 0.20149 ± 0.00012 |
| Pin peak/average (120 pins) | 2.2544 (upper estimate) |
| Peak / average power density | 6.595 / 2.165 W/cm³ |

Homogenized-core bracket (baseline statistics): k_eff = 1.132505 (H-in-ZrH),
1.145259 (H-in-H₂O), 1.136651 (free gas) — a ≈1275 pcm spread caused by a
genuine OpenMC restriction (one S(α,β) table per nuclide per material) that
makes a fully smeared core physically ill-posed here. pcM's reported core
value is the heterogeneous one.

Fuel and clad temperatures are now available from the two-way OpenMC-MOOSE
production run. Coupled coolant velocity, pressure, temperature, and turbulence
fields remain unavailable until NekRS production and three-way coupling finish.

Binder OpenMC-MOOSE production, ENDF/B-VII.1, 10 Picard iterations:

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| Final k-effective | 1.3066210577542 ± 0.00055 |
| Average / maximum fuel temperature | 330.390708 / 358.995333 K |
| Average / maximum clad temperature | 322.278940 / 336.145067 K |
| Integrated pin heating | 2083.33 W |
| Runtime | 2905.49 s |

Full report: `results/PCM_RESULTS.md`.

## Runtime

| Run | Wall clock |
|---|---|
| Unit cell production (20 M) | 456 s |
| Core production (20 M) | 365–446 s |
| Unit cell baseline (2.5 M) | 44 s |
| Core baseline (2.5 M) | 38 s |
| Binder OpenMC-MOOSE production (10 Picard iterations) | 2905.49 s |
| Standalone NekRS CUDA diagnostic (1000 steps) | 319.21 s |

Cold OpenMC timings used 8 OpenMP threads on the Apple M2. The coupled and
NekRS timings used the Binder Xeon/GTX 1080 Ti environment; the NekRS
diagnostic was an intentional serial fallback because the available MPI
launcher produced singleton processes.

## Next Step

1. Regenerate `fluid.re2` from the corrected mesh generator and confirm the
   nondimensional wall area is 123.4708.
2. Rerun standalone NekRS and verify mass and energy balance before extracting coolant temperature, velocity,
   pressure, and turbulence outputs.
3. Implement and smoke-test three-way OpenMC-MOOSE-NekRS coupling.
4. Run production, post-process, and provide the independent pcM package to the
   supervisor for comparison.

Answers to Q1 and Q4 are needed before the core result can be considered
final; the unit-cell result does not depend on them.

## Questions for Supervisor

**Q1 — Core geometry (blocking for Model 2).** "Single zone 0.495 × 0.60 m" is
ambiguous. Is 0.495 m the core **diameter** or the **radius**, and is the zone a
cylinder or a rectangular slab? pcM's provisional reading is a cylinder of
diameter 0.495 m × height 0.60 m, because at the specified 4.235 cm pitch that
gives ≈107 fuel positions — the right order for a TRIGA Mark I. A radius of
0.495 m would imply ≈429 elements, which is not a Mark I. Confirm before pcM
runs the core case.

**Q2 — OpenMC version deviation.** The spec names OpenMC **0.16.0**. This
machine has none: Cardinal's embedded solver is **v0.15.3-190-g66359e5dd** and
the Python API is **0.15.1.dev0**. Is running on 0.15.3 acceptable for the
benchmark, or must 0.16.0 be installed first? This is a reproducibility
question, not a physics one, but the spec said "reproduce exactly."

**Q3 — SS304 definition.** Density and composition are not in the spec. pcM
assumed 8.00 g/cm³ with standard SS304 composition. Confirm or supply the
approved values.

**Q4 — Homogenization and reflector for the core model.** Should the single
zone be smeared using the unit-cell volume fractions (pcM's default), and is
the core genuinely **bare** with vacuum boundaries — i.e. no graphite
reflector? A bare TRIGA core is a large departure from the physical reactor,
so pcM wants this confirmed as intentional rather than assumed.

**Q5 — Is the +0.5 $ transient in scope?** PCM_WORKFLOW.md defines a
steady-state production run and no transient phase, but the approved conditions
mention a +0.5 $ insertion. Confirm whether pcM should produce a transient
result set as well.

**Note on independence.** pcL's results were disclosed to pcM in the same
message as the approved conditions. This is recorded in
`spec/independence.md`, together with pcM's commitment not to tune toward them
and not to perform the pcL↔pcM comparison. pcM will report its own numbers
whatever they are.
